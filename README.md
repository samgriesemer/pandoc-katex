# pandoc-katex
This is a simple Pandoc filter for rendering server-side KaTeX using node.js.  Most of the code here is taken from [node-pandoc-katex](https://github.com/ericphanson/node-pandoc-katex),
which is broken with the current version of Pandoc (2.10.1 at the time of writing). This fixes that by simplifying some of the outdated dependencies of original `node-pandoc-katex` repo.
